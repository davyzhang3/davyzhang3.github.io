# 1.What is Data Engineering?
It is a method, a technique, or a job role that a person is professional to handle data and work with data in terms of storing it and converting raw data into useful information. so Data Engineer is a person who has the ability to or maintain the data in the system, work with data and eventually store it after the data processing has been done

# What is data modeling?
data modeling is not about describing data structure, like drawing entity diagrams for data. It is different to ML modeling, which is for making predictions.

Data modeling is a very simple step of simplifying an entity here. in the concept of data engineering. you will be simplifying a complex software into diagrams. Think of flow chart, it breaks a system into many entity diagrams so that you can understand the function of each part of the system.

# 3. what are the design schemas

2 kinds of schemas: one is star schema, there is one main table in the middle and other sub tables at each end of the star connecting to the main table. 
the other one is snowflake schema, there is a main fact table and multiple dimension tables which have sub tables

star schema is more easy to implement.
snowflakes schema is more efficient and it will have a better amount of usages in terms of efficiency and responsiveness 

# 4. What are the differences between structured and unstructured data
structured data is sorted into rows and columns, it is sorted based on some factors, like a Excel sheet.
unstructured data is like any sort of images, videos or music
We can used a database management system to store structured data, 
the methodologies to store unstructured data depends on the particular application.

# 5.what is hadoop
A open source framework for handling big data.
runs applications on clusters, which is a group of computers
Gold standard of the day when it comes to handling big data

# 6. what are some of the important components of Hadoop?
HDFS: hadoop file system is where all data is stored when working with Hadoop. It provides a distributed file system with very high bandwidth

Hadoop YARN: Yet Another Resource Negotiator is used for managing resources in the Hadoop system

Hadoop Common: consists of all libraries and utilities that are commonly used by the Hadoop application

Hadoop mapReduce: it provides users access to large-scale data processing

# 7. NameNode
Namenode stores all the HDFS data and metadata of actual data. But the actual data is stored in datanode

# 8. Hadoop Streaming
# 9. what are some of the important features of Hadoop
It is open-sourced framework, provides people faster ways to process data because of parallel computing. Data is stored and backuped in different computers

# 10.Four Vs of big data
Volume: describing how big the data is
Variety: many kinds of data coming from different sources
Veracity: the quality of data
Velocity: the speed of processing data

# 11. What is Block and Block Scanner in HDFS
Block is considered as a singular entity of data, which is the smallest factor. When Hadoop encounters a large file, it automatically slice the file into smaller chunks called blocks
Block scanner is put into place to verify whether the whether there is any loss of blocks when hadoop split the files

# 12. How does a Block Scanner handle corrupted files?
# 13. How does the NameNode communicate with DataNode
they communicate via messages: heartbeat and Block reports

# 14 What is meat by COSHH
Classification and Optimization-based Scheduling for Heterogeneous Hadoop systems
this is the basic working of COSHH, there are many good tools and methodologies to schedule activities in the level at the cluster. It ensures all your applications work on time not in haphazzard 

# 15 What is star schema
 a fact table in the middle and a group of dimension table surrounding it.
 
 # 16 what is snowflake schema
 The data is split into many more tables when you compare it to a star schema.
 
 # 17 Differentiate between Star schema and Snow flack schema
